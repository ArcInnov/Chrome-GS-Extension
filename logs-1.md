# Rebuilding getting started chrome extesnion
What is a service worker in an extension?

Putting popup.html in action {"default_popup": "popup.html"} in manifest json opens it as soon as extension is clicked

 Code snippet to show icon at extension management page 
  "icons": {
    "16": "/images/get_started16.png",
    "32": "/images/get_started32.png",
    "48": "/images/get_started48.png",
    "128": "/images/get_started128.png"
  } 

Pinning the extension will display the icon in the toolbar.

The button appears as per demo shown in page but there are sligh difference like size of button is smaller

You made file popup.css iinstead of button.css theefore your demo was not matching with documentation demo

There is something wrong I dont know what but will resolve it later

How does box shadow work?

What does a div tag do?
The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document. The <div> tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript. The <div> tag is easily styled by using the class or id attribute

I dont still fully understand the 4 button optioon,js

But We can say that the extension works
